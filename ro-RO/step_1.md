## What you will make
In this resource you will learn how to create and use an encryption technique known as the one-time pad. This method of encryption will allow you to send secret messages to your friends and, as long as you're careful, the messages will be *unbreakable*.

## What you will learn
By writing the secret agent chat program, you will learn:

- How random numbers can be used to encrypt messages
- How iteration can be used to encrypt individual characters
- Why techniques such as the Caesar cipher are insecure
- Why it's important to keep your keys a secret
